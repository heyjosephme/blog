# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer based in Tokyo, building full-stack applications with TypeScript and Next.js. I'm passionate about cloud infrastructure and creating scalable web solutions.

This blog is my digital garden where I share practical insights about:
- Full-stack development with TypeScript/Next.js
- Cloud infrastructure and DevOps practices
- Lessons learned from real-world projects

When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring Tokyo's coffee shops with my laptop, probably debugging with a matcha latte nearby.

Check out my portfolio at [here](https://heyjoseph.me) to see my projects and work experience.
